# Avocado_Sales
 
In this private project I analyze the Avocado sales of US cities. 

I visualized some relevant analyses with Tableau, which can be found on this dashboard: [Tableau Dashboar Avocado Sales](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nele.hapig/viz/AvocadoSalesUSnew/Dashboard1)

The data was downloaded from open source sites and can be found here: 

- [Avocado prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices/data)
- [US city data](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities)

This project is a work in progress and will be updated with more advanced analyses in the near future.
